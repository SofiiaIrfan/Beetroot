        Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
        looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
        <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an introduction
        to the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
        applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With
        React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well
        as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
        components:
        <i class="italic-text">bundles of reusable, nestable code.</i>
        You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs
        cover how components work in React Native.

    <p>
        React Native runs on <a href="#"> React</a>, a popular open source
        library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most
        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
        get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
    </p>
    <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
    <p>
        <b class="bold_text">+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to
        React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that
        need names and a cafe to work in.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b class="bold_text">+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax
        that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
        <span class="highlighted-text"
        >&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;Text&gt;</span
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        The React docs have a <a href="#">comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can
        refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
        variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
        <span class="highlighted-text">name</span> for the cat, name, and
        embedding it with curly braces inside
        <span class="highlighted-text">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
    </p>
    <p><b class="bold_text">+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
    <p>
        <b class="bold_text">+ state.</b> While you can think of props as
        arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a
        component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
        that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
        your components memory!

<section class="handling-input">
    <h2>
        handling text input
        <span class="sup-text">Chapter 4</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has
        an <i class="italic-text">onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to
        be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
        takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their
        words into a different language. In this new language, every single word
        is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
        translated as "üçï üçï".
